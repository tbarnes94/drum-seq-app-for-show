# Drum Sequencer App
## Tommy Barnes

This was my response to the assignment given via email:

Assignment:

Create a drum beat/step sequencer for the web or iOS/Android.  Check out a quick 30 second overview of what this is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA--iN1nAFE.  Pick any sounds you want (get creative).  You can find samples at https://freesound.org and elsewhere on the web.

Requirements:

- [x] This should take a day to a day and a half.
- [x] Upload this to a private GitHub repo and add my username malkodrum when finished.
- [x] There are 8 tracks (rows), and 16 columns per track which represent each step.
- [x] Your sounds can be hard-coded into each track.
- [x] This should be a single page/view
- [x] The time should be 120 BPM

Extra Credit:

- [x] Don't use any third party libraries for playing audio, each platform has built in functionality
- [x] Add a play / stop / pause button
- Add the ability to change the BPM
- Tests

Not Mentioned:
- [x] Linting (eslint & babel-eslint using AirBnB style)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
